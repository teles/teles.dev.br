### Discover the Power of ArrayMixer: The JavaScript Library for Custom Array Ordering

In the programming world, handling and ordering arrays can be a tedious and repetitive task. This is where **ArrayMixer** comes in, a lightweight and powerful JavaScript library, under 1KB, designed to simplify the organization of array groups in a highly customized manner. Whether for Node.js or web projects, ArrayMixer offers an efficient and easy-to-use solution for your ordering needs.

#### Key Features

**Incredible Flexibility:** With only two mandatory parameters, `aliases` and `sequence`, you can create complex combinations of arrays intuitively. Define aliases for your arrays and create display sequences as needed.

**Easy to Use:** The simplicity of ArrayMixer is one of its greatest advantages. With a single line of code, you can mix arrays of photos, ads, texts, links, songs, and more, following specific patterns.

**Practical Examples:** The library comes with several examples illustrating how to use it in different scenarios, such as displaying ads after a certain number of photos, including images in text paragraphs, or organizing sponsored links within lists.

#### Usage Examples

1. **Display Ads Among Photos:**
   ```javascript
   const mixedArray = ArrayMixer({P: photos, A: ads}, ["2P", "1A"]);
   ```

2. **Include Images in Texts:**
   ```javascript
   ArrayMixer({P: paragraphs, I: images}, ["4P", "2I"]);
   ```

3. **Organize Sponsored Links:**
   ```javascript
   ArrayMixer({R: related, S: sponsored}, ["4R", "2S", "2R"]);
   ```

#### Installation

**For Node Projects:**
```bash
npm install array-mixer --save
```

**Import:**
```javascript
const ArrayMixer = require("array-mixer");
```
